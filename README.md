# Raspberry Pi components

Information about the integration with the different HATs, pHATs and other type of components that can be attached to the Raspberry Pi will be mantained here.

That includes things like installation requirements as the goal is ensuring the correct dependencies are mantained here, regardless of the provider of the component. They typically require the installation of a Linux Distribution package or the execution of a script, while I prefer explicit dependencies to allow for greater portability (even if in the end every project would require running on a Pi).
